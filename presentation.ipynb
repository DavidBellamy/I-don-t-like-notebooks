    "# Background\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- We do a lot of programming at FL97 and only more to come. Coding is an inevitable component of standardizing and automating the work we do.\n",
    "    - In fact, I would love to be able to say that we are the most code-literate company with a wet lab.\n",
    "- Whenever we write code, we care about it ***********************actually working as expected for ourselves and for others***********************. Right?\n",
    "    - From that simple premise, I will argue that notebooks are fundamentally bad.\n",
    "    - They encourage bad habits,\n",
    "- There is a *notebook mafia* out there that has been forcing the use of notebooks in data science courses both online and on university campuses for years.\n",
    "    - This is producing more and more data scientists and machine learning practitioners who don’t know how to write good code.\n",
    "    - This causes a division in many organizations, there are the notebook users and the software engineers. The notebook users (typically with titles like “data scientist” or “machine learning scientist”) do scrappy work and then toss it over the fence to “the real engineers” once they have a finding. The real engineers are then tasked with migrating their notebooks to robust modules and scripts. In practice, this requires the engineers to re-write and re-test all of this code and often the code will not work as the notebook user expected!\n",
    "    - But we don’t like tossing things over the fence here, we know that this doesn’t work well!\n",
    "    - Notebooks are fundamentally bad for reproducibility and are therefore bad for data science or machine learning, which already suffers from reproducibility issues.\n",
    "- The list of advantages that you get by moving away from notebooks and towards modules and scripts is so long that I couldn’t even cover it in 10 hours.\n",
    "    - Instead, I chose to highlight the most widely applicable and immediately valuable features for those of you right now that would like to level up your programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who am I to comment on this?\n",
    "- I went through this notebook-ridden education system! I took university courses and online classes that do all their assignments in the form of notebooks.\n",
    "- I have been a teaching assistant for classes that use notebooks and have had to correct and grade hundreds of student submissions in the form of notebooks.\n",
    "- You can view me as a survivor or someone who has made it to the other side and escaped the notebook mafia. So I’m here to tell you what it looks like from the outside. @img/chatgpt_reject.png"
